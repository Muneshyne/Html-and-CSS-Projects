Inline (also written in-line) refers to code contained within the webpage. The opposite of inline is code kept in an external file (like a URL or an external style sheet).
The <span> tag connects inline elements and provides a way to connect text. It literally spans (stretches across) a section of code. Hereâ€™s an example:-->
    <p>
        His wife had <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">green</span> eyes,
        his children had <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes,
        but his eyes were <span style="color:brown;font-weight:bold">brown</span>.
