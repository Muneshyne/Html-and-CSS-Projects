        <h1>Let me tell you about a girl I knew. <br>This is a story of the unfaithful wife. <br> This was the outcome.<br></h1>
        <section>
            <p>Jerry was a nice all around guy. He would go to work 9-5 and when he got home to, who he thought was a wonderful and faithful wife, she would have food ready at 6pm sharp.
                Now Jerry was very loving, never abusing his wife or verbally scalding her, quite the opposite actually. He was very supportive and never asked for anything in return. One day
                Jerry asked his wife if he could go to school full time to major in Computer Science while she went to work full time during that time.

        <p>A few months down the road and Jerry was in school full time as his wife was working full time during the day. Jerry was very excited that he was in school but a feeling of worthlessness 
            started to slowly creep up inside of him. Jerry thought he was not doing enough for his family to provide, things got a little bumpy in his relationship with his wife as Jerry found it hard to 
            even get out of bed. Jerry's wife decided she also would like to go to school but they bothe could'nt go at the same time. With no extra income they would be sure to end up in the streets.
            So Jerry thought it was best if he put school off for the time being, seeing this as an opportunity to go back to work and regain his worth.

                This put the most tension between him and his wife. They couldn't be around each other for more than 1 hour. Jerry felt sad and his wife would go out with her new found friends at school.
                Not to study but to party, why was Jerry not invited? Well turns out Jerry's wife had found a new boyfriend at school and Jerry being the nice guy stayed home and did'nt say anything hoping 
                that it was all in his head. A few months went by they both barely talked now and Jerry's wife supprised him with big news.
